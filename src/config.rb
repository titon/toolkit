# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/"
css_dir = "css/"
sass_dir = "scss/"
images_dir = "img/"
javascripts_dir = "js/"

preferred_syntax = :scss

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):
#output_style = :compressed

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false

# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass css scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
